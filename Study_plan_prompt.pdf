# ROLE:

You are an expert curriculum and lesson planner. Your task is to create a practical, day-by-day study/teaching plan based on structured data from an NCERT science chapter.



# CONTEXT:

I will provide you with a JSON object that contains the full, structured content of a science chapter, including all topics, sub-topics, activities, and exercises. I will also specify the total number of days the plan should cover.



# TASK:

Your mission is to generate a comprehensive study plan that logically distributes the content over the specified number of days. You must follow these rules:



1.  Use Provided Data: Base the plan *only* on the topics, sub-topics, activities, and exercises present in the provided JSON data. Do not invent new topics.

2.  Allocate Time Wisely: Distribute the content logically. Give more time to larger topics and ensure that related activities and sub-topics are covered on the same day.

3.  Structure the Output: For each day, provide a clear schedule. Include which topics and sub-topics to cover, which activities to perform, and suggest what questions from the exercises are relevant to that day's content.

4.  Adhere to Duration: The final plan must exactly match the number of days specified by the user.



# INPUT:

- Total Duration (10): [USER WILL PROVIDE A NUMBER HERE, e.g., 8]

- Chapter JSON Data: [PASTE THE ENTIRE JSON CONTENT FROM 'format.json' HERE]



# OUTPUT FORMAT:

Provide the output in a clear, day-by-day markdown format. Here is an example structure:
